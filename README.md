## General Info

This is personal project that I worked on in order to gain further experience creating interactive web applications with Vanilla JavaScript. The goal of this project was create a signup form for a website, which is not only responsive, but also validates the user's input. I imagined that the login form might be for an online fantasy game, which is what inspired my design choices.
